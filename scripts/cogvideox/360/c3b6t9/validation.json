The crossbars are detailed with regularly spaced rivets, creating a symmetrical, structured appearance. The helmet is placed on a simple dark circular base, against a muted greenish background. [VIDEO] the video animates the helmet standing upright on the same round pedestal, captured from the side, slowly rotating 360 degrees. As the helmet turns, its curved dark surface and the gold crossbars with riveted accents are fully revealed. The structure appears solid and symmetrical, with the gold detailing consistently highlighted by soft lighting. The background remains plain and unobtrusive, keeping the focus on the helmetâ€™s metallic textures and design.",
